                    <h9>
                        I'm Amanda Huang a 19 years old girl from Taiwan. In the future, I would like to
                        be a Product Designer, an Electrical Engineering, or UX/UI Designer. I enjoy using my 
                        creativity to solve daily life issues. My goal is to find creative solutions to daily 
                        problems falls in line with industrial or product design. I feel confident and 
                        satisfied when I hear people say, “your ideas are pretty good” or “I never thought 
                        about that.” Empathy is a skill I find more important than ever in the three years of 
                        Design Thinking courses I took in high school. The designer is not always the one who 
                        is experiencing the problem, so it is important to comprehend the problem in the user's
                        shoes. Everyone has lots of creativity but being able to shine from the rest depends on
                        whether you can make the idea become a reality. Whether you are an Electrical Engineering
                        or Product Designer, the success of a project is what makes you stand out from the crowd. 
                        If you have “empathy” in what you are doing, you are already halfway successful in your 
                        career.

                        Internet of Technology, is something I started to be curious when I raise to Freshman.
                        I learn how IoT makes our life so easy and convenient. I learn that this would be a trend
                        in the future.

                    <h9>
                        During the volunteering job in World Vision International. I understand how lucky I am 
                        that I don't need to care whether I will be strave the next day. I learn the empathy 
                        that we should stand in underprivileged groups' shoes and look at the world. We should
                        be charish what we have right now. What we own right now are what our parent use there 
                        hard work to earn for us. We can't take anything for granted.
